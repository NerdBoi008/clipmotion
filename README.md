# ClipMotion

**ClipMotion** is a CLI tool that turns animation ideas from real‑world videos (Instagram reels, TikTok, YouTube, etc.) into reusable components for modern web frameworks.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/clipmotion.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipmotion)

## Getting Started (User Flow)

### 1. Initialize ClipMotion in your project

```bash
clipmotion init
```

This will:

- Detect your framework (Next.js, React, Vue, Angular)
- Create `clipmotion-components.json` with:
  - `framework`
  - `aliases.components`
  - `aliases.utils`
  - `registry.baseUrl` (points to the hosted JSON registry)

Example config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://clipmotion.dev/schema.json",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "components",
    "utils": "components/utils"
  },
  "registry": {
    "baseUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nerdboi008/clipmotion/main/public/r"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Utils are placed inside the components folder by default to avoid conflicts with existing `lib/utils` files in your project.

---

### 2. Add a component

```bash
clipmotion add blur-image-toggle
```

This will:

- Fetch the component definition from the registry
- Install any required npm dependencies
- Write component files to your configured `components` alias

Options:

```bash
clipmotion add blur-image-toggle --overwrite      # overwrite files if they exist
clipmotion add blur-image-toggle --debug          # verbose logs
clipmotion add blur-image-toggle --path src/ui    # custom target path
```

#### Framework Override

By default, Clipmotion installs components for the framework defined in your configuration.

If a component is not available for your current framework, you can override it:

```bash
clipmotion add blur-toggle --framework react
```

**Example:**
Your project is **Next.js**, but the component only exists for **React**:

```bash
clipmotion add some-component --framework react
```

#### Installing Multiple Components

You can install multiple components in a single command:

```bash
clipmotion add blur-toggle fade-in --framework vue
```

### Helpful Suggestions

If a component is not available for the selected framework, the CLI will:

- Detect available frameworks for that component
- Suggest compatible alternatives
- Provide clear, actionable error messages

This ensures you always know **what’s available and how to proceed**.

---

### 3. Find a component by video URL

If you saw an animation in a reel / short / TikTok and it’s in the registry:

```bash
clipmotion find https://www.instagram.com/p/DRPOaKMiItG/
```

The command will:

- Look up the URL in the registry index
- Show details (name, difficulty, supported frameworks, tags)
- Let you choose to:
  - Install the component
  - View demo
  - See implementation guide

You can also auto‑install:

```bash
clipmotion find <video-url> --install
```

## Handling Utils Files

ClipMotion components may depend on shared utilities like `cn()` (className merger).

**How it works:**

1. **First component with utils** → Creates `components/utils/index.ts`
2. **Second component with utils** → Merges new functions into existing file (if not duplicate)
3. **Duplicate functions** → Skipped automatically

**Example:**

```bash
clipmotion add blur-toggle
# Creates components/utils/index.ts with cn()

clipmotion add fade-in
# Merges any new utils into components/utils/index.ts
# Skips cn() if already present
```

**Manual override:**

```bash
clipmotion add component-name --overwrite
# Replaces utils file entirely (use with caution)
```

## Repository Structure (For Contributors)

In this repo, source components live in `registry/` and are compiled into JSON under `public/r/` for the CLI.

```txt
registry/
├── nextjs/
│   ├── ui/           # Next.js components
│   ├── lib/          # Shared utilities (optional)
│   └── hooks/        # Hooks (optional)
├── react/
├── vue/
└── angular/

public/
└── r/
    ├── nextjs/       # Generated JSON for Next.js components
    ├── react/
    ├── vue/
    ├── angular/
    └── index.json    # Registry index used by `clipmotion find`
```

The CLI commands use:

- `registry/*` as the **source of truth**
- `public/r/*` as the **runtime registry** for installs

---

## CLI Commands

### `clipmotion init`

Initialize ClipMotion in an existing project.

- Detects framework from files (`next.config.*`, `angular.json`, `vite.config.*`, `package.json`)
- Asks for confirmation or manual choice if needed
- Sets default component + utils paths
- Installs framework‑specific deps (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, etc., where relevant)

---

### `clipmotion add`

Add one or more components from the registry:

```bash
clipmotion add <components...>
```

Supports:

- Registry dependencies (other internal components/utils)
- npm dependencies and devDependencies
- Overwrite checks for existing files
- Debug logging

---

### `clipmotion find`

Find and optionally install a component by video URL:

```bash
clipmotion find <video-url> [options]
```

- Matches normalized URLs against `public/r/index.json`
- Shows metadata and next steps (install / demo / guide)

---

### `clipmotion create`

Scaffold a new component **inside this repo** for contributors:

```bash
clipmotion create <component-name>
```

The command will:

- Ask for framework, video URL, description, category, difficulty
- Create:
  - `registry/<framework>/ui/<component-name>.tsx|.vue`
  - `registry/<framework>/examples/<component-name>.tsx|.vue`
  - `registry/<framework>/<component-name>.README.md`
  - `registry/<framework>/CONTRIBUTING.md` (if missing)

This is the recommended way for contributors to start a new animation.

---

### `clipmotion registry:build`

Build the JSON registry used by `add` and `find`:

```bash
clipmotion registry:build
```

What it does:

- Scans `registry/<framework>/ui`, `lib`, `hooks`
- Extracts:
  - Files
  - npm dependencies
  - dev dependencies
  - registry dependencies (e.g., `@/lib/utils`)
- Emits `public/r/<framework>/*.json` with a `RegistryItem` structure
- Generates `public/r/index.json` with:
  - List of animations
  - Framework support
  - Basic metadata
  - `lastUpdated` timestamp

---

## Contributing

Contributions are **welcome and encouraged**.

- Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for:

  - Local setup
  - Component creation flow
  - Registry build process
  - PR checklist

- Please also review the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Typical flow for adding a new animation:

```bash
# 1. Create component scaffold
clipmotion create blur-image-toggle

# 2. Implement animation in registry/<framework>/ui/...
# 3. Build registry
clipmotion registry:build

# 4. Test installation in a sample project
clipmotion init
clipmotion add blur-image-toggle

# 5. Commit & open a PR
```
